Suka beach inn is right next to poppies lane 2 and close to legian and also the nightlife , still quiet if you want to sleep in peace . Quite cheap accommodation and facilities are good . 7min walk to kuta beach and staff at suka is nice . Don ' t expect too much of the free breakfast and pool is missing sunbeds . Otherwise a good place .#### #### ####[([0, 1, 2], [20], 'POS'), ([13], [11], 'POS'), ([17], [11], 'POS'), ([31], [30], 'POS'), ([33], [35], 'POS'), ([40, 41], [37, 38], 'POS'), ([43], [47], 'POS'), ([58], [49, 50, 51, 52], 'NEG'), ([60], [62, 63], 'NEG'), ([68], [67], 'POS')]
I stayed at this place during my family visit to Bali . Very beautiful hotel with poor service and maintenance . Cleanliness of the pool is unacceptable . Restaurant staff was friendly . Food is tasty but choices are limited .#### #### ####[([14], [13], 'POS'), ([17], [16], 'NEG'), ([19], [16], 'NEG'), ([24], [21], 'NEG'), ([28, 29], [31], 'POS'), ([33], [35], 'POS'), ([33], [37, 38, 39], 'NEG')]
Our flight was early in the Morning and know that it wasnt check in time , so i asked them to keep the luggage while we are waiting the room . but surprisingly they give us the key without additional charges , it ' s so flexible and kind management . . they have a nice pool on their top floor where you can see 360 degrees of Bali . .#### #### ####[([49], [48], 'POS'), ([42, 43, 44], [46], 'POS'), ([56], [55], 'POS')]

Stayed here following a recommendation from a fellow traveller . Very surly staff , unhelpful . However , the room was clean and comfortable . Nice balcony and stunning gardens and pool . But they are SO difficult to contact . By phone or email . I left my big pack there and now back in UK !#### #### ####[([12], [11], 'NEG'), ([12], [14], 'NEG'), ([19], [21], 'POS'), ([19], [23], 'POS'), ([26], [25], 'POS'), ([29], [28], 'POS'), ([31], [28], 'POS'), ([34], [37, 38, 39], 'NEG')]
The hotel has a great location for its price . They also have a cozy restaurant which facing the kuta road . I personally like the rooftop pool and the water flow in the shower .#### #### ####[([5], [4], 'POS'), ([15], [14], 'POS'), ([15], [17, 18, 19, 20], 'POS'), ([34], [24], 'POS'), ([26, 27], [24], 'POS')]
Stayed here for 4 nights second floor standard room , breakfast has less varieties but still delicious . Room is spacious and comfy . Staff is friendly , and service is sincere even though a little bit messy . The drawback is that the location is a little bit far from Kuta and Legian , however you can easily rent a bike or get a cab .#### #### ####[([63, 64, 65], [58], 'POS'), ([59, 60, 61], [58], 'POS'), ([10], [12, 13], 'NEG'), ([10], [16], 'POS'), ([18], [20], 'POS'), ([18], [22], 'POS'), ([24], [26], 'POS'), ([29], [31], 'POS'), ([29], [37], 'NEG'), ([44], [49, 50, 51, 52, 53], 'NEG')]
Near any area at seminyak , hotel is quite good , service is nice , and the best is the hotel is not expensive haha , been here for 5 days and have no regret . If someone thinks that love and peace is a cliche that must have been left behind in the Sixties , that ' s his problem . Love and peace are eternal .#### #### ####[([6], [9], 'POS'), ([11], [13], 'POS'), ([20], [22, 23], 'POS')]
This old hotel is in the center of the Kuta area and on the beach . The rooms are quite depressing as they are below ground and have no windows . If you only sleep and enjoy the great poolside view the place is OK . Four adults stayed her in the beginning of May 2017 .#### #### ####[([17], [20], 'NEG'), ([17], [24, 25], 'NEG'), ([17], [27, 28, 29], 'NEG'), ([42], [44], 'NEU')]
Booked in for a week stayed 3 nights and moved over to The 101 across the road . Beds were hard and pillows terrible . No hot water for two days and toilet gurgled all night , No shower screen which made the bathroom constantly wet and smelly .#### #### ####[([43], [45], 'NEG'), ([43], [47], 'NEG'), ([25], [26, 27], 'NEG'), ([32], [33], 'NEG'), ([37], [38, 39], 'NEG'), ([18], [20], 'NEG'), ([22], [23], 'NEG')]
