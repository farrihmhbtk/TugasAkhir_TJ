In November my computer messed up entirely and would n't power on after intalling a Windows update , I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it , including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things , when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history .#### #### ####[([15, 16], [4, 5], 'NEU')]
