So happy with this purchase , I just wish it came with Microsoft Word .#### #### ####[([12, 13], [8], 'NEU')]
It has enough memory and speed to run my business with all the flexibility that comes with a laptop .#### #### ####[([3], [2], 'POS'), ([5], [2], 'POS')]
The battery life is excellent , the display is excellent , and downloading apps is a breeze .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [4], 'POS'), ([7], [9], 'POS'), ([12, 13], [16], 'POS')]
The screen , the software and the smoothness of the operating system .#### #### ####[([10, 11], [7], 'POS')]
But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny .#### #### ####[([6], [9], 'NEG'), ([12], [16], 'NEG')]
The built quality is really good , I was so Happy and excited about this Product .#### #### ####[([1, 2], [5], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [10], 'POS'), ([1, 2], [12], 'POS')]
I am loving the fast performance also .#### #### ####[([5], [2], 'POS'), ([5], [4], 'POS')]
Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface ( courtesy of the Mac OS ) and the range is poor .#### #### ####[([8, 9], [7], 'NEG'), ([14, 15], [11], 'NEG'), ([19], [21], 'NEG')]
My only gripe would be the need to add more RAM .#### #### ####[([10], [2], 'NEG')]
Fine if you have a touch screen .#### #### ####[([5, 6], [0], 'NEU')]
