Ordinary budget hotels in Bali are usually not really hygienic . But this particular budget hotel is surprisingly the utmost opposite . Especially the toilet area . . ! ! kuddos to everyday . Staffs were smiling all the time but it seems that they were having a difficult time speaking English to me . Overall . . . love it and I really am looking forward in staying again . .#### #### ####[([55], [59], 'POS'), ([34], [36], 'POS'), ([50, 51], [48, 49], 'NEG')]
Feels like at home . Location is good . Near to sunset road . Friendly staffs . We will stay here for sure when in Bali . Cannot wait and very excited until July 2016 for next bali visit . My kids love to stay here . Minus : 2nd wooden floor is noisy when someone walk will disturb neighbour .#### #### ####[([5], [7], 'POS'), ([15], [14], 'POS'), ([49, 50, 51], [53], 'NEG'), ([40, 41], [42, 43, 44], 'POS')]
I have stayed there for 3 days with family . Location is very good . Hotel staffs are friendly and provide all helps and recommendation . I would recommend to stay there when you are on solo trip . You can find other better options when you are planning trip to Kuta along with family .#### #### ####[([10], [13], 'POS'), ([16], [18], 'POS'), ([16], [20, 21, 22], 'POS'), ([30], [28], 'POS')]

I visited the hotel for a short stay , business meeting . The hotel is located in a resort with beautiful gardens , pools and includes free access to private beach club " Klappa " . Staff is very friendly , helpful and flexible . Restaurant offers good cuisine . Rooms are exceptionally spacious .#### #### ####[([21], [20], 'POS'), ([45], [47, 48], 'POS'), ([50], [53], 'POS'), ([36], [39], 'POS'), ([36], [41], 'POS')]
Highly recommended . The hotel is near the malls , money changers , shops , and especially the beach . The whole staff was friendly and accommodation though the food needs improvement . Overall , the experience is very good .#### #### ####[([36], [39], 'POS'), ([29], [30, 31], 'NEG'), ([8], [6], 'POS'), ([10, 11], [6], 'POS'), ([13], [6], 'POS'), ([22], [24], 'POS'), ([22], [26], 'POS')]
Clean , safe and no frill hotel . We did not dine at the hotel as so many eating out options are available right outside the hotel . Small grocery shop on the left side of hotel for your quick snacks fixes .#### #### ####[([6], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([6], [2], 'POS'), ([6], [0], 'POS'), ([29, 30], [31, 32, 33], 'POS')]
Cocok untuk backpacker maupun orang - orang dengan budget terbatas . Meski demikian , spazzio cukup nyaman . The security cannot help anything . When i want to crossed the street by motorbike , they didn ' t help . just watch me .#### #### ####[([14], [16], 'POS'), ([19], [20, 21], 'NEG'), ([2], [0], 'POS'), ([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [0], 'POS')]

Clean modern hotel . Room comfortable and fine for what we needed . Roof top pool is lovely however small and minimal amount of loungers although we had no problem getting one the day we used . In fact had it to ourselves for few hours which was lovely .#### #### ####[([2], [0], 'POS'), ([4], [5], 'POS'), ([4], [7], 'POS'), ([13, 14, 15], [17], 'POS')]
